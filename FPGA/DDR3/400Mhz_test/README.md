RedCape_VA2
===========
Jrunner
==========
Test the DDR3 at 400Mhz
==========

To test if everything is connected right and the DDR3 is working in the RedCape, just configure the cyclone V with this project.

$ ./jrunner ddr3_test400.cdf

If the LEDs D5 and D4 (LEDs 1 and 2) light up,then everything is working. In case LED D6 ( 0 ) lights up instead of LED D5, then the test project detected a fail. It will be necesarry to compile the test project and to see using the SignalTap II Logic Analizer what might be wrong. Use the External Memory Interface Toolkit as well, as it can give a clearer insight of what may be causing the error.
